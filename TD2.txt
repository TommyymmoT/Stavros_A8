canister.
The line of police, most with guns drawn and aimed toward the remaining demonstrators, then moved forward en masse. After the streets were mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave, saying someone had been shot and there was a “public safety” issue.
“There is a dangerous dynamic in the night that allows a small number of violent agitators in the crowed to attempt to create chaos,” Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, in charge of the police operation, said later. “I stood there and listened over the radio to the screams of those officers who were under gunfire. I went back to our SWAT vehicle and saw a gentleman in the back who had been shot. I saw a car pull up and drop off a gentleman who was shot … We can’t have this.”
Two fires were lit, 31 people arrested and two pistols seized from men pulled from a car just across the street from a police-designated media marshaling area, said an emotional Capt. Johnson, who urged journalists not to “glamourize” violent demonstrators.

Capt. Johnson said bottles and Molotov cocktails were also thrown from the crowd. He did not have condition updates on those who were shot. Johnson said four officers were injured by rocks or bottles.
Demonstrators no longer faced the neighbourhood’s midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters they couldn’t assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. Officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions used bullhorns to order protesters to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers, and fired tear gas and flash grenades.
For helping the RCMP to corral a local fugitive, a trio of Manitoba border guards have been suspended without pay for leaving their posts, according to their union.
“They should be decorated, not punished,” said Jean-Pierre Fortin, president of the Customs and Immigration Union, which represents members of the Canadian Border Services Agency.
The incident occurred Feb. 27 near the Emerson border crossing, one of only three 24-hour border crossings between Manitoba and the United States.
As per the union, two Emerson RCMP officers had zeroed in on a local hotel containing a man wanted on outstanding warrants — and suspected of being armed.
They should be decorated, not punished
With a population of only 700, Emerson’s RCMP detachment consists of only one corporal and four constables. At the time, backup units were apparently either unavailable, or located 30 minutes away in Morris.
