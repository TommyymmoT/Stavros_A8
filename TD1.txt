A mostly sedate protest against the police shooting of a St. Louis-area teenager descended into hazy chaos late Monday night, as police fired several rounds of tear gas and chased down die-hard protesters, saying later that some officers had come under “heavy gunfire” and two civilian men had been shot.
A generally orderly, if emotional, rally over the death of Michael Brown turned into a tense standoff around 11 p.m. after police dramatically arrested two demonstrators, and a phalanx of riot officers took position at one end of a blocked-off section of road.
The officers, backed up by three or four armored vehicles, advanced and retreated toward a cluster of protesters who had congregated in the middle of the street.
Several rally organizers, meanwhile, tried to restore order to the gathering, which they said was being undermined by a few “provocateurs” determined to make trouble and force a police reaction.
Then shots of some kind could be heard at the other end of the street, at least some of them from tear-gas canisters fired by police. Wafts of acrid gas spread over the area as protesters and members of the large media contingent coughed and covered their eyes. A fire erupted in a restaurant near the confrontation, which protesters blamed on an errant tear-gas canister.
The line of police, most with guns drawn and aimed toward the remaining demonstrators, then moved forward en masse. After the streets were mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave, saying someone had been shot and there was a “public safety” issue.
“There is a dangerous dynamic in the night that allows a small number of violent agitators in the crowed to attempt to create chaos,” Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, in charge of the police operation, said later. “I stood there and listened over the radio to the screams of those officers who were under gunfire. I went back to our SWAT vehicle and saw a gentleman in the back who had been shot. I saw a car pull up and drop off a gentleman who was shot … We can’t have this.”
Two fires were lit, 31
